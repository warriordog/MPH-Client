# MPH-Client - A client program for Mining Pool Hub

MPH-Client is an auto-switching mining framework for Mining Pool Hub.  With it, custom auto-switch combinations can be created to allow auto-switching in ways that are impossible using the MPH-provided auto-switching ports.  
Almost any miner, coin, and algorithm combination can be supported through configuration files, and utility scripts are provided to generate configuration files even easier.
